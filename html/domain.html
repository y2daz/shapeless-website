                                <h1>Fluids</h1><br />
                                <p>Most liquid simulation software uses the particle based simulation model to get accurate and realistic results for fluid renderings.
                                    These use complicated algorithms and procedures to calculate physical phenomena like dynamic ripples, buoyancy, animating waves and foam.
                                    These simulations can take from a few minutes to close to an hour to render a single frame. <br/><br/>
                                    Computing particle based fluids has been identified as resource intensive, yet realistic.Particle based methods also have to be explicitly parallelised. <br/><br/>
                                    In video games, maintaining a minimal render time for the system is of utmost importance.
                                    Games have to be able to run at 60 frames per second, leaving only about 15 milliseconds to render a single frame.
                                    The particle based method for simulating fluids is therefore unsuitable for a video game environment, which requires real time rendering.
                                </p>
                                <h1>Softbodies</h1><br />
                                <p>
                                    Commercial game engines provide full support for rigid bodies in games, handling movement, collisions and other interactions.
                                    When considering meshes and their interactions, a major contributor to the performance edge that engines have over more accurate
                                    simulation software, is due to the optimisation targeted at rigid bodies.
                                    This however, makes the game engine itself poor at handling soft bodies.<br/><br/>
                                    As a result of this, existing games rarely use deformable meshes, and ones that do, rely on proprietary systems by middleware vendors
                                    to achieve dynamic real-time deformations. These systems rely on the rigid-body based deformation systems, of which literature is
                                    mostly non-existent.The discussed finite element simulation method, although accurate, takes too long to render in real time,
                                    so hasn't widely been used in video game environments.<br/><br/>
                                    The shape matching method, is a non-physically based computation method for deformable solids, which means that it doesn't provide
                                    deformations accurately, prioritising frame render speed. This makes shape matching ideal for real-time rendering situations like
                                    in video games.<br/><br/>
                                    Mass-spring systems have been applied to games, but mostly exist for cloth systems, with a specialised version working for the
                                    Chainmail Algorithm.
